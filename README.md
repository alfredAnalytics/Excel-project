# Road Accident Analysis

**Analysis Overview**

This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive breakdown of road accident casualties that occurred between 2021 and 2022. It delves into the categorization of casualties by vehicle types, road categories, accident locations, and lighting conditions. The primary focus is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

**Data Cleansing and Preprocessing**

The initial phase involved meticulous data cleansing to ensure data suitability for analysis. Duplicate records were systematically eliminated utilizing the "remove duplicate" function within Excel. To enhance data clarity, abbreviated words were expanded using the find and replace function. 

Subsequently, data was visualized through the strategic use of Pivot Charts to discern monthly trends across the two years. Donut Charts were employed to provide further illumination on key performance indicators (KPIs), specifically focusing on casualties concerning location, casualty severity, and lighting conditions. Road surface casualties were systematically dissected and presented using a Tree Map, while casualties categorized by road type were elucidated through Bar Charts.

**Trends and Insights**

The analysis yielded the subsequent significant findings:

1. Fatal casualties accounted for a mere 1.9% of the overall casualty count.
2. The highest incidence of casualties was attributed to car-related accidents.
3. A substantial 165,000 casualties were documented on single carriageways.
4. Urban settings and low-light conditions exhibited a higher prevalence of casualties in contrast to rural areas and daylight hours.
5. A notable disparity in casualty counts was observed between the two years, with 2021 experiencing a higher incidence.

This analysis provides a data-driven perspective on road accident casualties, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of these incidents between 2021 and 2022.
